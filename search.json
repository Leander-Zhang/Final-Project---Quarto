    "text": "Data Visualisations Under Examination, adopted from: What Makes a Visualization Memorable?(Borkin et al.,2013) )\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Affective Data Visualisation Research\n\nThe idea of “emotional appeals in visualisation” (Kostelnick, 2016), “affects/pathos in visualisations” (Campbell, 2018) or “affective visualisations” (Gough, de Berigny Wall and Bednarz, 2014) are emerging in recent years. Those concepts have been used in studying the objectivity / subjectivity of visualisations, the effectiveness of certain visual elements and et cetera.\nWith all those concepts and researches scattered in different areas related to visualisations, Lan, Wu and Cao (2024) have conducted a systematic review of the existing researches. Within their review, one thread takes my attention: emotion as a result of visualization design.\nIn this project, Affective Data Visualisation is defined as data visualisation that are able to conveyance messages with the help of emotions and will be put under examination that whether and how they affect the effectiveness of message.\nAs for the research question, I want to test if affective design is also helpful in the marketing / promotion scenario, since no research has been on this till now (August 2024).\n\nResearch Method\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nWith literature review, three main methods are identified to be most likely to be effective as affective data visualisation methods:\n\nZoom-in (Personalised) Design \nAffective Colour Scheme \nRealistic / Metaphorical Imagery \n\nTo test whether those methods are effective when applied to marketing / promotion scenario, I designed several pairs of affective / non-affective (“normal”) data visualisations and conducted an AB test through interview.\nAs for the aspects to test if the affective data visualisation is effective, three main aspects are indentified through literature review:\n\nMessage conveyance \nAudience Engagement \nCall to Action \n\n\nInterview Structure\n\nFor the interview, the audience will be either shown the three “normal” version of data visualisations or the three affective ones. Each of the data visualisations will be shown will questions asked.\n\nBefore the visualisation shown, the participant will be asked about their interest level of the topic of the visualisation (score from 1-5).\nThe visualisation will be shown for 20 seconds.\nThe visualisation will be hidden, and the participant will be asked if certain numbers are in line with the visualisation / certain messages are conveyed with the visualisation.\nThe visualisation will be shown again, then the participant will be asked to what extent they agree that now they understand more about the topic (score from 1-5).\nThe participant will be asked about their interest level on the topic now (score from 1-5).\nThe participant will be asked about to what extent they are more likely to take action (either consider more before next purchase or directly purchase) after viewing the visualisation (score from 1-5).\n\nThis process will be repeated with all three visualisations. Then, with all visualisations hidden, participant will be asked to tell if certain numbers / claims are in line with these visualisations.\nWith these steps, all three aspects of effectiveness of affective data visualisation will be tested:\n\n\n\nInterview Structure\n\n\n\nResearch Result\n\nClick Here for Research Results."

With this method, the aim is to rule out the effects of words and colours (which can also be a method of affective design).\nAs for the application of personalised design, it was achieved by adding the healthy-looking human figure grabbing breads to enhance personal connection with the audience who are looking for bread and a healthier life through a multi-grain loaf.\nFor realistic / metaphorical Imagery, I applied realistic imagery by using the actual photo of different amounts of grains to show the percentage of grains contained in the loaf. \n\nDevelopment Process\n\nFor the affective version, I found this original photo from a website and re-purposed it as a marketing material with some PhotoShop work.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Picture\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Result\n\n\n\nAs for the “normal” version, i used R in Rstudio to generate the following plots:\n\ngrainlabel &lt;- c(\"Sesame\", \"Sunflower\", \"Flaxseed\", \"Rye\", \"Wheat\", \"Barley\")\ngraincolor &lt;- c(\"#F0E68C\", \"#C4A484\", \"#8B5A2B\", \"#A0522D\", \"#F5DEB3\", \"#BDB76B\")\nA.val &lt;- c(10, 15, 15, 20, 20, 0)\nB.val &lt;- c(0, 0, 15, 85, 0, 0)\nC.val &lt;- c(0, 15, 15, 0, 0, 70)\n\n\nPIE.val &lt;- cbind(A.val, B.val, C.val)\n\n# dev.new()\n\npar(mfcol = c(2, 3), bg = \"lightgrey\")  \n\n\nfor (i in 1:3) {\n  \n  labels &lt;- ifelse(PIE.val[, i] &gt; 0, grainlabel, \"\")\n  \n  par(mar = c(0, 3, 0, 3))\n  \n\n  pie(PIE.val[, i], labels = rep(\"\", length(labels)),\n      col = graincolor, border = TRUE , radius = 1)\n  \n\n  angles &lt;- cumsum(c(0, PIE.val[, i])) / sum(PIE.val[, i]) * 2 * pi\n  \n\n  label_pos &lt;- angles[-length(angles)] + diff(angles) / 2\n  \n\n  text(x = 1* cos(label_pos), y = 1 * sin(label_pos), \n       labels = labels, cex = 1.2, col = \"black\",font = 2)\n  \n  par(mar = c(5, 3, 2, 2))  \n\n  bp &lt;- barplot(PIE.val[, i], col = graincolor, ylim = c(0, max(PIE.val)), \n                names.arg = grainlabel,  \n                las = 2,  \n                yaxt = \"n\"  \n  )\n  \n\n  y_ticks &lt;- pretty(c(0, max(PIE.val)))  \n  y_labels &lt;- paste(y_ticks, \"%\", sep = \"\")\n  \n\n  axis(2, at = y_ticks, labels = y_labels, las = 2, cex.axis= 0.8)\n  \n\n  percent_labels &lt;- paste(PIE.val[, i], \"%\", sep = \"\")\n  \n\n  text(x = bp, y = PIE.val[, i], label = percent_labels, pos = 3, cex = 0.65, col = \"black\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n Then with bit more PhotoShop, i have the “normal” version of the data visualisation that contains all the same information as the affective one.\n\n\n\nThe “Normal” Version Data Visualisation of marketing material of a multi-grain bread loaf."

    "text": "Research Result\n\n\n\nInterview Result\n\nThe comparison between the affective and non-affective versions of the data visualisations revealed notable differences across the three aspects: message conveyance, audience engagement, and ability to call to action.\nIn terms of message conveyance, participants viewing the affective versions were able to grasp a greater number of messages compared to those viewing the non-affective versions. In the test result, the audience of the affective version got a 6.9% higher rate of identifying whether certain message is conveyed through the visualisation. However, they were less accurate in recalling if specific numerical data is right (a -5.8% rate of identifying is certain number is mentioned in the visualisation), suggesting that while emotions helped in conveying general ideas, precise details were more challenging to retain. Participants also reported a deeper overall understanding of the topics after viewing the affective visualisations. To be more detailed, the audience of the affective version report a 75% average score of agreeing that then know more about the topic after viewing the data visualisations, while the percentage is 54% for the “normal” version.\nRegarding audience engagement, participants exposed to the affective designs exhibited a higher increase (11.4% more increase) in interest in the topic, as reflected in their post-visualisation interest scores. Furthermore, they were able to recall more general messages from the visualisations (5.6% more), although there was no significant difference in the number of specific data points remembered between the two groups (-0.9% in accuracy).\nFinally, in terms of ability to call to action, participants were expressing a higher intention (3.5% more likely) to act (whether considering further or making a direct purchase) after viewing the affective visualisations. This suggests that the emotional elements incorporated into the designs may be more persuasive in motivating audience behaviour than the non-affective versions.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, the results indicate that affective data visualisations are more effective compared to non-affective ones in a marketing or promotional context. They not only enhance the conveyance of messages and foster a deeper understanding of the topic but also significantly increase audience engagement and interest. Additionally, affective visualisations demonstrate greater potential in motivating the audience to take action, making them a valuable tool in promoting products or ideas. These findings suggest that incorporating emotional elements into data visualisation design can enhance both the communicative and persuasive power of the visual content."
